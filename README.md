# MessCoin

MessCoin is a digital mess coupon system that replaces the traditional paper coupon system with a digital coin-based transaction model. It integrates secure payments, authentication, and meal tracking for hostel mess management.

## Features
- **Digital Payments:** Allows students to pay for meals digitally.
- **Authentication:** Supports biometric authentication for secure transactions.
- **Transaction History:** Users can view their top-up and spending history.
- **Hostel Management:** Students are assigned to hostels, and data is stored accordingly.
- **Extra Meals & Menu Tracking:** Tracks extra meal requests and displays the mess menu.


## Authentication Flow
- If **biometric authentication** is available, users must authenticate before making a payment.
- If the device **does not support authentication**, users can proceed with payment without authentication.
- If **PhoneAuth** is enabled, users must verify their identity before payment.

## Usage
1. **Select Hostel**: On first launch, users select their hostel.
2. **Login/Register**: Users log in or register with their student details.
3. **Top-up Balance**: Users can add funds to their MessCoin wallet.
4. **Make Payment**: Users authenticate (if required) and pay for meals.
5. **View History**: Users can check their transaction history.
